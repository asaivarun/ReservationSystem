# ReservationSystem

In this project,  Developed requirements, designed classes, and created tests validating the well-designed reservation system with GUI using software development life cycle .
The goal was to build a reservation system for students to schedule an appointment with Teaching Assistant during office hours.

Under this system, office hours would be split into discrete time blocks with the schedule of those blocks posted publicly. Students see times a TA that will be available and can reserve one of the open times and can cancel also. To support TAs, I maintained a queue of students holding current reservations.  By working from the queue, the TAs could be efficient in meeting with as many students as possible. 

In Requirements phase, Developed requirements like UML use cases, use case graphical representation, User Stories.
